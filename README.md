# SkillBridge AI 🚀
## Bias-Free Internship Matching Platform for Tier-2/3 Students

SkillBridge AI is a hackathon project designed to bridge the gap between talented students from non-elite colleges and top internships using AI-driven skill matching.

### 🏆 Hackathon Goals
- **Problem**: Students from Tier-2/3 colleges are often ignored due to college bias.
- **Solution**: An AI platform that extracts skills from resumes and matches them to internships based on **capability, not college name**.
- **Impact**: Democratizing access to career opportunities.

### 🤖 AI Features (Under the Hood)
1. **Resume Parser**: Automatically reads text/PDFs and extracts technical & soft skills using NLP keywords.
2. **Skill Matcher**: Calculates a compatibility score (0-100%) against job requirements.
3. **Gap Analyzer**: Identifies exactly what skills a student is missing for a specific role.
4. **AI Career Mentor**: A chatbot providing personalized advice on resumes and interviews.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React.js, Vite
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion (for premium animations)
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **Logic**: Custom JavaScript "Mock AI" engine (Client-side)
